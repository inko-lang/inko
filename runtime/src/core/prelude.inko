# The prelude module imports various modules of which the contents should be
# available to every other module. Any globals that should be exposed to every
# module must be defined in std::globals instead.

# The order in which modules are imported is important as some modules may
# depend on types / methods defined in other modules.

# The very first module we have to import is std::trait. This module defines a
# few methods that _must_ exist before we can import any other methods.
import std::trait

# Next up we import std::object, which defines a few methods other modules
# depend on.
import std::object

# The std::boolean module must be imported next since many other modules depend
# on the methods it defines. This module also refines the "Boolean" trait
# defined earlier in std::bootstrap.
import std::boolean

# Now that most of the crucial bits and pieces are in place we can start
# importing other modules. At this point the order of the imports doesn't matter
# much any more.
import std::integer
import std::float
import std::nil
import std::block
import std::string
import std::array
import std::array_iter
import std::map::(Map as _Map)
import std::inspect
import std::byte_array
import std::process
import std::vm
import std::range::(Range as _Range)
import std::integer::extensions

# These constants are re-exported so they're available to all modules by
# default. Core types such as String should be exposed in std::globals instead.
