# Assertions for writing unit tests.
#
# Assertions can be used to define requirements that must be met for a unit
# test to pass. For example, the `equal` method can be used to assert that two
# values must be equal to each other.
#
# Assertions will throw in the event of a failure, requiring the use of the
# `try` keyword. The use of `try!` is discouraged as it will result in the
# entire test suite terminating in the event of an assertion failing.
