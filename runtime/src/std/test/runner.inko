#! Registering and running of unit tests
#!
#! This module provides various types and methods for working with test runners.
#! A runner is an object that manages a list of tests, executes them, and
#! displays the results using a `std::test::formatter::Formatter`.
#!
#! A runner is made out of three components:
#!
#! 1. A `RunnerState` object, which stores the state of a `Runner`.
#! 2. A `Runner` object, which runs in a separate process and is responsible for
#!    executing tests.
#! 3. A `Client` object, which sends messages to a `Runner`. A `Client` can be
#!    copied to other processes, but each `Client` always belongs to a single
#!    `Runner`.
#!
#! A `Client` communicates with a `Runner` by sending it objects that implement
#! the `Command` trait. A `Runner` in turn will send the `run` message to these
#! objects, passing its instance of `RunnerState`. This allows for type-safe
#! message passing, without the need for pattern matching.
