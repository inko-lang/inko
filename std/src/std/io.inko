# A type that wraps a `Write` type and buffers the output.
#
# Writing to a `Write` type can be expensive. The `BufferedWriter` type
# maintains an in-memory buffer of data to write, flushing it to an underlying
# stream whenever necessary. This can improve performance when performing many
# small writes using the same stream. If writes instead involve large data sizes
# or the writes are rare, the use of this type isn't likely to bring any
# benefits.
#
# It's recommended to call `BufferedWriter.flush` before dropping a
# `BufferedWriter`. While this type implements `std.drop.Drop` and tries to
# flush the buffer when it's dropped, any errors produced by the flush are
# ignored.
#
# # Examples
#
# ```inko
# import std.fs.file (WriteOnlyFile)
# import std.io (BufferedWriter)
#
# let file = WriteOnlyFile
#   .new('out.txt')
#   .or_panic_with('failed to open the file')
# let writer = BufferedWriter.new(file)
#
# writer.write('hello') # => Result.Ok(nil)
# writer.flush          # => Result.Ok(nil)

  #
