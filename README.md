# Inko

Inko is a language for building concurrent software with confidence. Inko makes
it easy to build concurrent software, without having to worry about
unpredictable performance, unexpected runtime errors, or race conditions.

Inko features deterministic automatic memory management, move semantics, static
typing, type-safe concurrency, efficient error handling, and more. Inko source
code is compiled to machine code using [LLVM](https://llvm.org/).

For more information, refer to the [Inko website](https://inko-lang.org/) or
[the documentation](https://docs.inko-lang.org). If you'd like to follow the
