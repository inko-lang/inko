# Introduction

Inko is a programming language for building concurrent software with confidence,
and has been under development since 2015.

The Inko manual contains information about how to get started with Inko, a
reference for existing users, details about the standard library and compiler,
how to contribute to Inko's development, and more.

The manual assumes you have prior experience working with programming languages,
and that you are familiar with terminal emulators.

You can contribute to the manual by submitting changes or bug reports to the
[Inko repository](https://github.com/inko-lang/inko).
