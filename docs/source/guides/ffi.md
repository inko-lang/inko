# Foreign Function Interface

!!! note
    Inko used to have a foreign function interface using libffi. This has been
    removed with the introduction of the native code compiler. We're working on
    a new FFI. For more information and progress updates, refer to
    [this issue](https://github.com/inko-lang/inko/issues/290).
