# Conditional compilation

While Inko code is portable across platforms and architectures, sometimes you
need to handle differences in the underlying platforms, most commonly when using
the [FFI](../ffi).

Inko supports conditional compilation at the `import` level only. This makes it
easier to understand the code, as platform specific code ends up in dedicated
modules.

For example, to import the module `foo` only on amd64 Linux platforms, you'd
write the following:

```inko
import foo if linux and amd64
```

## Compiling conditional imports

The tags act as an AND, meaning the `import` is only processed if _all_ the
specified tags are available. OR expressions and negations aren't supported, but
OR expressions can be handled by just using separate imports:

```inko
import foo if linux
import foo if mac
```

Build tags are applied when parsing Inko source modules to an AST, and imports
that should be ignored based on the build tags are removed when lowering to
[HIR](../..//internals/compiler/#hir).

This means that if a conditionally compiled module includes any errors (e.g. a
type error), those errors won't surface until you compile the code such that all
build tags are available. In other words: if you have a `import foo if mac`
statement, and the `foo` module contains any errors, you won't see those errors
until you compile your code for/on macOS.

The compiler won't produce any errors for tags it doesn't recognise, meaning the
following import is never processed:

```inko
import foo if kittens
```

## Available build tags

!!! note
    Custom build tags aren't supported, nor are we likely to support them any
    time soon as this complicates the build process.

The following tags are available, and are based on the target an Inko program is
compiled for:

| Tag         | Meaning
|:------------|:--------------
| `amd64`     | The platform is a 64-bits x86 platform
| `arm64`     | The platform is a 64-bits ARM platform
| `freebsd`   | The target OS is FreeBSD
| `mac`       | The target OS is macOS
| `openbsd`   | The target OS is OpenBSD
| `linux`     | The target OS is Linux
| `bsd`       | The target OS is any BSD
| `unix`      | The target OS is any Unix system
| `gnu`       | The target uses the GNU ABI
| `native`    | The target uses the native ABI

The bag `bsd` is essentially `(freebsd OR openbsd OR ...)`, while `unix` is
essentially `(freebsd or openbsd or linux or mac or ...)`.

For Linux targets using glibc, the ABI is `gnu` instead of `native`. For the
time being the ABI tags aren't useful, but in the future we may support both
musl and GNU builds, at which point they can be useful to handle differences
between the two libc implementations.
