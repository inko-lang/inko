Inko's native code compiler is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and
uses [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) as its backend. The generated machine code links
against a small runtime library, also written in Rust.

This guide covers the steps needed to get Inko installed on your platform of
choice.

## Supported platforms

Inko supports Linux (4.11 or newer), macOS (11.0 or newer), and FreeBSD (13.2 or
newer). Inko might also work on other platforms, but we only provide support for
the listed platforms. Windows isn't supported.

## Requirements

- Rust 1.84 or newer
- LLVM 18 or newer
- A C compiler such as [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or
  [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/)
- Git, for managing packages using the `inko pkg` command

::: note
While using newer versions of LLVM may work, it's possible for a newer version
to introduce breaking changes. As such, we recommend only using a newer version
of LLVM if your platform doesn't offer a package for the version listed above.
:::

The code generated by the compiler comes with the following system requirements:

- A 64-bits little-endian platform
- For AMD64: a CPU supporting x86-64-v2 or newer
- For ARM64: a CPU with [Neon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family#Advanced_SIMD_\(Neon\))
  support

## Cross-platform

The easiest way to install Inko is to use Inko's own version manager:
[ivm](ivm). ivm supports all the platforms officially supported by Inko.

When installing Inko using ivm, you must first install the dependencies listed
[here](#dependencies).

Once ivm is installed, you can install Inko as follows:

```bash
ivm install latest
```

::: note
ivm installs Inko from source, so you'll need to install the necessary
[dependencies](#dependencies) for your platform first.
:::

This installs the latest known version. If you want to install a specific
version, run the following instead (where `X.Y.Z` is the version you want to
install):

```bash
ivm install X.Y.Z
```

For more details on how to use ivm and switch versions, refer to the [ivm
guide](ivm).

## Docker

If you are using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or
[Podman](https://podman.io/), you can use our official Docker/Podman images.
These images are published on
[GitHub.com](https://github.com/inko-lang/inko/pkgs/container/inko).

To install a specific version, run the following (replacing `X.Y.Z` with the
version you want to install):

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/inko-lang/inko:X.Y.Z # Using Docker
podman pull ghcr.io/inko-lang/inko:X.Y.Z # Using Podman
```

You can then run Inko as follows:

```bash
docker run inko-lang/inko:X.Y.Z inko --version # Using Docker
podman run inko-lang/inko:X.Y.Z inko --version # Using Podman
```

We also build a container for every commit on the `main` branch, provided the
tests are passing. If you like to live dangerously, you can use these as
follows:

```bash
# Using Docker:
docker pull ghcr.io/inko-lang/inko:main
docker run inko-lang/inko:main inko --version

# Using Podman:
podman pull ghcr.io/inko-lang/inko:main
podman run inko-lang/inko:main inko --version
```

## Arch Linux

Inko is available in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/):

```bash
yay -S inko     # Latest stable release
yay -S inko-git # Latest Git commit
```

## Fedora

Inko is available as a
[Copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/yorickpeterse/inko/) repository:

```bash
sudo dnf install dnf-plugins-core
sudo dnf copr enable yorickpeterse/inko
sudo dnf install inko
```

## FreeBSD

Inko is available [as a port](https://www.freshports.org/lang/inko):

```bash
sudo pkg install inko
```

## macOS

Inko is available in [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install inko
```

## Nix

Inko is available in the [unstable
channel](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&show=inko&type=packages&query=inko):

```bash
nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/nixpkgs-unstable nixpkgs-unstable
nix-channel --update
nix-shell -p inko
```

## From source

When building from Git, first clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/inko-lang/inko.git
cd inko
```

Or use a release tarball:

```bash
VER='0.15.0' # Replace this with the latest version of Inko

mkdir $VER
curl https://releases.inko-lang.org/$VER.tar.gz -o $VER.tar.gz
tar -C $VER -xf $VER.tar.gz
cd $VER
```

You can then compile Inko as follows:

|=
| Mode
| Command
| Executable
| Runtime library
|-
| Debug
| `cargo build`
| `./target/debug/inko`
| `./target/debug/libinko.a`
|-
| Release
| `cargo build --release`
| `./target/release/inko`
| `./target/release/libinko.a`

In both cases the standard library in `std/src` is used. You can customise the
standard library and runtime library paths by setting these environment
variables when running `cargo` build:

- `INKO_STD`: the full path to the directory containing the standard library
  modules, defaults to `./std/src`.
- `INKO_RT`: the full path to the directory containing the runtime libraries to
  link the generated code against, defaults to `./target/MODE` where `MODE` is
  either `debug` for debug builds or `release` for release builds.

If you are building a package, it's recommended to use the provided `Makefile`
instead, as this simplifies the process of moving the necessary files in place
and using the right paths. To compile a release build of Inko, run `make` and
`make install` to install the files. This process can be customised by setting
the following Make variables:

- `DESTDIR`: the directory to install files into when running `make install`.
- `PREFIX`: the path prefix to use for all files, defaults to `/usr`. When
  combined with `DESTDIR`, the value of `DESTDIR` prefixes this value.

For example:

```bash
make PREFIX=/usr/local
make install DESTDIR=./package-root PREFIX=/usr/local
```

The `PREFIX` variable must be set for both the `make` and `make install`
commands, but `DESTDIR` is only necessary for `make install`.

## Dependencies

necessary dependencies.
