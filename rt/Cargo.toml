# We use graviola instead of ring or aws-lc-sys because:
#
# 1. aws-lc-sys requires cmake to be installed when building on FreeBSD (and
#    potentially other platforms), as aws-lc-sys only provides generated
#    bindings for a limited set of platforms
# 2. aws-lc-sys increases compile times quite a bit
# 3. cross-compiling aws-lc-sys is difficult depending on the target platform
# 4. We don't care about FIPS compliance at the time of writing
# 5. ring's maintenance is spotty/uncertain in the future
#   (https://github.com/briansmith/ring/discussions/2414)

# These dependencies are used by the customized version of

# https://github.com/inko-lang/inko/issues/329 for more details.
