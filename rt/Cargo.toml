# We use ring instead of the default aws-lc-sys because:
#
# 1. aws-lc-sys requires cmake to be installed when building on FreeBSD (and
#    potentially other platforms), as aws-lc-sys only provides generated
#    bindings for a limited set of platforms
# 2. aws-lc-sys increases compile times quite a bit
# 3. We don't care about FIPS compliance at the time of writing

# These dependencies are used by the customized version of

# https://github.com/inko-lang/inko/issues/329 for more details.
