/// Stacks all share the same size and can't grow beyond this size. The decision
/// to not support growable stack is for the following reasons:
///
/// - It can mask/hide runaway recursion.
/// - It requires a prologue of sorts in every function to check if there's
///   enough stack space remaining.
/// - Depending on the backend used we may not have enough information to
///   accurately determine the amount of stack space a function needs.
/// - It's not clear when/if we would also shrink the stack, and doing this at
///   the right time is tricky.
/// - Foreign function calls would require that we either grow the stack to a
///   reasonable size, or swap the stack with a temporary stack of a larger
///   size. Both add complexity and incur a runtime cost we're not happy with.
/// - Even with a 1 MiB stack per process one can easily run millions of
///   processes and not run out of virtual memory.
/// - Processes aren't likely to use even close to the full amount of stack
///   space, so all the trouble of resizing stacks likely just isn't worth it.
/// - Fixed size stacks make it easier to reuse stacks, as we don't need to
///   divide them into size classes and pick the appropriate one based on the
///   size we need.
///
/// The amount of reusable stacks is reduced every now and then to prevent a
/// pool from using excessive amounts of memory.
